Forecast of research trends for Knowledge Representation

Time series analysis techniques to predict research trends based on their past behaviour around Knowledge Representation. 
Knowledge Representation is a part of artificial intelligence that describes how we can represent knowledge in artificial intelligence 
so that an intelligent machine can learn from knowledge and experiences so that it can behave intelligently like a human 
and solve real-world problems. 
Like diagnosing a medical condition or communicating with people in a natural language.
